Figure 4.26 Exterior of H6PSM (Hi6-N Controller Power Supply Module)

The following figure shows the power system diagram for the AC control power related to the opening and closing of the 3-phase AC power for the motor power, the generation of the brake power, and the driving of the fan. The diagram in the figure also shows the power distribution, such as the SMPS power for the DC power supply to the control module. A circuit breaker (CP) or fuse is connected to each power to protect individual circuits against overcurrent.
