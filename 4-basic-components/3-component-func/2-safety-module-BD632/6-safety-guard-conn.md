# 4.3.2.6. Connection of the Safety Guard 

(1\) General Safety Guard

The general safety guard operates regardless of the controller's mode (automatic or manual). In other words, when a person enters inside the installed safety guard or when the guard is broken, the controller will immediately shut off the motor power. The safety guard that can be used should be in the form of contact output. In the terminal block TBEM, terminals are configured in a way that they connect the contact outputs of the safety guard to the dual safety chain, as shown in the figure below.

If the general safety guard is not to be used, connect the terminals (pins 15-7 and 16-8) of the terminal block TBEM, as shown below, to disable the input.

\(2\) Automatic Safety Guard of Contact Input Type 

The automatic safety guard operates only when the controller is in the automatic mode and provides two inputs, as shown below. Like a general safety guard, the automatic safety guard should be in the form of contact output. In the terminal block TBEM, terminals are configured in a way that they connect the contact outputs of the safety guard to the dual safety chain, as shown in the figure below.

If the automatic safety guard is not to be used, connect the terminals of the terminal block TBEM((pins 11-3, 12-4, 13-5 and 14-6), as shown below, to disable the input.
