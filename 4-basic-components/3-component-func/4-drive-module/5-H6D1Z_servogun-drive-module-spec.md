# 4.3.4.5. H6D1Z (Servo Gun Drive Module; Optional)

The drive module performs a power amplification function that allows the current to flow to the individual phases of the motor according to the current command from the servo board. The servo gun drive module can drive one motor of 50A or below and is configured as follows.
